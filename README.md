# Audio Visualizer
A C++ and CUDA program for creating an Audio Visualizer in order to replicate the "Monstercat Style".

Although it is not yet exact it is getting close to the Monstercat Style.

Fourier Analysis and Frame Generation is custom made, video output created using FFMPEG.

All Fourier Analysis and Frame Generation is done on the GPU using CUDA.

# Background

Throughout highschool I was a huge Monstercat, No Copyright Sounds and Dubstep Gutter fan with some of my favourite artists still releasing music under their labels (Slander, RIOT, Mazare, RUNN, Grant, iMeiden, Geoxor, and Many More). I loved their Visualizers, with my favourite being the Monstercat Visualizer since it showed the range of Frequencies and intensity which after learning in University is just a Fourier Transform, with some data processing sprinkled in to make it more appealing.

As of late, now that I'm more familiar with the Math behind visualizing audio I thought I'd give it a shot. And I would say I'm halfway there as many improvements can be made before I can call it finished.

Once I do finish it I want to try and bundle it into a Discord Bot, a CLI tool, a Website or a mix and match of all 3.

# Example Songs
The Following are some of my favourite songs visualized using the program. Improvements still need to be made.
