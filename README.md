# Audio Visualizer
A program that creates a Video using FFMPEG with an audio visualizer for the song provided. It replicates the "Monstercat" style for Audio Visualized Songs. 

Uses C++ and CUDA to generate the Video. C++ as the base, CUDA is used to accelerate the frequency analysis and generate the Frames for the Video.

Plans are to eventually bundle it up into a Discord Bot and Docker Container
